# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**
---
- This is an analysis of various crowdfunding campaign conducted in various countries and tehir correlation with launch date and goal amounts.
---
### **Purpose**

- The purpose of this analysis is to provide a report to our client, Louise who organized a crowdfund project by way of a play titled --Fever--. She has approached us for providing her with an analysis to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
---
## **Analysis and Challenges**
- As detailed below, our data analysis is based on the following two criteria,(i)Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date and (ii)Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
---
### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

- As shown above, a monthwise comparison of outcomes(Succesful, failed, Canceled) for the theater campaigns was done. It was observed that the months May, June, July and August marked the highest number of theater campaigns. Also, successfull campaigns were higher during May and June.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

- As shown above, a comparison of outcomes(Succesful, failed, Canceled) based on their goal amounts for the sub category _Plays_ was done. The goal amounts were divided into twelve categories to get a better picture of the data. 
---
- It was observed that the successful _Plays_ were more for goal amounts of less than $5,000.00. It is also interesting to note that none of the cmpaigns under the sub category _Plays_ were canceled.
---
### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**
---
- If Louise could have specified where she wanted to conduct the -Play- we could have arrived at a realistic conclusion. A location wise analysis is directly related to the outcome of a campaign.
---
## **Results**
---
---
-What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
---
* Demand for _Plays_ were maximum during the month of May. 
---
* Success probability appears higher during the months of May and June approximately around 67%.
---
---
-What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
---
*_Plays_ with smaller goal amounts (less than $5,000.00) has higher probability for success.
* More than half of the total plays had a goal amount of less than $5,000.00. To be more specific, Louise can expect comparatively higher success with a goal amount between $1,000.00 and $5,000.00
---
-What are some limitations of this dataset?
---
* The total number of projects were 1042, out of which projects with goal amount >$15000 appeared as outliers (around 8% )which skewed the average success percentage to a considerable extent. In order to provide a realistic conclusion, these data should be excluded.
---
-What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
---
* A table showing monthwise percentage of outcomes based on launch date.
---
* A table showing descriptive statistics for the outcomes based on goals.
